### Scalability Considerations:  
**What challenges might arise when scaling?**  
- **High Traffic Spike** - When a highly demanded ticket is put up, tickets are claimed or used rapidly, leading to traffic surges.  
- **Oversold Tickets** - Similar to the airline seat problem, ensuring that tickets are not oversold is crucial.  
- **Database Partitioning** - Implementing sharding to efficiently manage growing user data and transactions.  
- **Winner Selection & Notification** - Ensuring a fair and transparent process for selecting and notifying winners.
