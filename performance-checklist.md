# Performance Optimization Guidelines

## Introduction
These guidelines ensure that all front-end performance best practices are consistently followed throughout the development lifecycle. All contributors must adhere to these procedures when submitting a Pull Request (PR) to maintain an optimized user experience.

## Performance Checklist Categories
Each PR should be checked against the following performance best practices before submission:

### [Rendering] - Optimizing Component Renders
- Use **lazy loading** for images and non-critical components.
- Optimize state updates to **minimize unnecessary re-renders**.
- Minimize unnecessary re-renders using `React.memo`, `useCallback`, `useMemo`.
- Avoid **excessive prop drilling** by using Context API or state management libraries.

### [Assets] - Improving Load Times
- Compress images and use modern formats (`.webp`, `.avif` instead of `.png` or `.jpeg`).
- Use **efficient font formats** (`.woff2` instead of `.ttf`).
- Remove unused fonts and minimize font variations to **reduce font loading time**.

### [Event Handling] - Optimizing Interactions
- Use **debouncing/throttling** for event handlers (e.g., `onScroll`, `onInput`).
- Avoid inline event listeners in loops to prevent unnecessary re-renders.

### [Network] - Reducing API Overhead
- Optimize API requests to **avoid redundant network calls**.
- Use **React Query or SWR** for data fetching and caching.
- Minimize data payload size by selecting only required fields in API responses.

### [Bundle Size] - Keeping the App Lightweight
- Reduce JavaScript bundle size with **code splitting** (`React.lazy()`, `import()`).

### [Performance Testing] - Profiling and Debugging
- Use **Chrome DevTools Performance Tab** to analyze render times.
- Use **React Profiler** to detect slow components.
- Run **Google Lighthouse audits** to check performance scores.

### [Animations & Rendering] - Enhancing UI Responsiveness
- Ensure smooth animations
- Minimize unnecessary **reflows and repaints** to reduce rendering overhead.

## Performance Review Process
Before merging a PR, ensure the following performance checks have been completed:

- **Run Lighthouse audits** and address any major performance issues.
- **Review API requests** to ensure no unnecessary calls are made.
- **Optimize asset sizes** and remove redundant dependencies.
- **Ensure animations and interactions remain smooth.**
